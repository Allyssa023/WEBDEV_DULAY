        <p><strong>Gandang bata! Sinong mama mo?</strong></p>
    
        <p>Hi people in the universe! It's me, Allyssa! Ally/Ashley for short.</p>
    
        <p>I am a 19-year-old student currently taking up Computer Science at LORMA Colleges.
        But before that, I completed my senior high school education at Saint Louis College, 
        where I took the STEM strand.</p>
    
        <p>I'm honestly excited for the journey ahead. I hope this sem will treat me well.</p>
